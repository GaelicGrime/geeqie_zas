  > Better keyboard support.

  - Add command line options to force show and hide of tools.

  * Fix gtk 1.2.0 related bugs.

0.5.1 (12-8-98)

  * Fix file highlight bug when user tab completes to currently displayed dir.
  * Fix for FreeBSD.

  * Fix bug when 'fit window to image' is on, tools float/hide, and the next

    mouse on the image. The arrow keys will pan too (use [Ctrl] to pan faster)
  > The file selection area and status line can be 'floated' into a separate
    window, this allows the image window to display more of the image.
  > The file delete confirmation dialog can now be disabled in the options
    window.
  > The beginnings of keyboard support ( see the keyboard chart, above )
  - Now if a thumbnail is older than it's parent image, the thumbnail is
    recreated, so that changed images have their thumbnail properly updated.
  - While loading thumbnails GQview is now responsive to commands, slowly, but
    it works. You can now load images, delete files, etc. while the thumbnails
    are being generated. The thumbnail generation can be interrupted too by
    simply turning them off.

    hopefully users of nis will be happy. If the directory is not found or

  - Other small changes including source re-organization.
  - Added a pixmap file to use as an icon (gqview.xpm).

0.3.2  (5-7-98)
  * Fixed a bug which made the first editor slot useless from config dialog.

0.3.1  (5-4-98)
  - Changed filelist code to properly implement Glist.
  - Moved definitions of variables and #includes to better places.

0.3.0  (4-24-98)
  > New feature! Thumbnails displayed in the file list(us 't' to toggle).
  > Thumbnails size can be selected (General Options).
  > Rewrite (again) of the file list (to support adding/removing entries
    without re-reading the entire directory listing, [still need to convert
    the directory list, however]).

     (will not work with previous versions of GTK)
  - Command line no longer requires a complete path to a file if it is in
    the current working directory. (or must be relative to it)
  - When moving to the next (or previous) image, the file list
    scrolls to include the current image's name.

0.1.0  (2-28-98)
  > Added menu bar.
  > Added keyboard shorcuts.
  > Configuration can be saved (to .gqviewrc in user's home dir)
  > Command line support. (specify startup directory or file to view)
  > Can set startup directory in options window (can be disabled)
  > Added custom filtering options to support more formats
     (Imlib supports almost anything your system can read using
      ImageMagick or Netpbm, if available).
  > File operations: create directory, rename file, delete file.
  > clicking mouse on image:
      button one: next image
      button two: previous image

    and is now readable (some code still needs organizing, but
    at least now the code can be followed).
  > Makefile rewritten, it may still need editing for some systems.
    The '-g' gcc option was removed for the released code, this makes
    the binary about 1/3 smaller (it removes some debugging facilities)
  - Fixed the transparency problem. This removes the garbage displayed
    where an image is transparent, unfortunately for now it is set to purple.

0.0.2  (2-14-98)
  > Rewrote directory and file list handling, the lists
    can now be of any length.
  > Lists are now sorted.
  > History list no longer expands out of control as the
    directory path gets longer, entries are truncated at
    32 characters and '/...' is prepended.
  > Added configuration window, including:
    - show or hide dot files
    - select default zoom mode for new image
    - disable file filtering
    - choose file types to filter
    - about tab for version and contact info

0.0.1  (2-10-98)
  > No history, first release!
