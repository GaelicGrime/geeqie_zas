======== Notes and changes for this release

  Changes:
    > Now use autoconf/make, resulting in a configure script.
    > Now supports i18n, added translations: de ja pt_BR ru
    > Remove 'save settings on exit', they are now always saved.
    > Copy/move dialogs now include drop down history.
    > Overwrite dialogs now display source and dest images.
    > Full screen toggle is now 'V'.
    > New command line options: -f or --fullscreen; -s or --slideshow; renamed
      long option to use -- instead of -.
    > New option 'set wallpaper' sets the root window to current image.
      (Scales in 'fit to window mode', tiles in all others) (edit menus).
    - Thumbnail mode is now remembered between runs.
    - During slideshows, next/prev image changes (space/backspace) now follow
      the slideshow progression.
    - Icons now update when size is configured.
    - When dragging files, and the action was a move, refresh the filelist.
    - Directory changes, and the filelist scrolls to follow tab completion in
      the main window.
    * Icons sizes are now properly remembered when the config dialog is opened
      then closed without re-selecting the size.
    * Less memory leaks :)

  Notes:
    bt_br.po is corrupt (my fault).
