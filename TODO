TODO key: d = done, w = work in progress, ? = possibly fixed, * = wt? - how?
          PB = can only be done after move to gdk_pixbuf

Major:
----------------------------------------------
 >fix translation pt_BR.po file (corrupted)

Minor:
----------------------------------------------
d>save thumbnail on/off setting.
 >properly restore main window when coming back from full screen.
   (position / maximized, etc.)
d>make space/back follow schedule during random slideshow.
 >add larger thumbnail option.
 >save history lists for move/copy dialogs, etc.
 >maybe show image in delete/rename/copy/move dialogs (should be simple now).
 >add a read-ahead buffer for next image, note that this will not be threaded. (PB)
  (gdk-pixbuf will allow it to be done in short idle calls, allowing interuption)
 >generate thumbnails in idle calls, instead of creating a new main loop to seem
  responsive.
 >make *'s const, where appropriate ()
 >make Escape key cancel dialogs.

 >progress meter during load, or progressive load. (PB)
 >add progress dialog when moving/copying/deleting multiple files. (PB)
 >.xbm file format not listed by default? .pnm, more?

 >ability to specify view window background color
 >show wait cursor during image load (after update to PB, may not be as useful)

 >reload should reload the image too. (PB) <-- reason: Imlib caching sometimes misses
    modification times.

Wishlist?:
----------------------------------------------
 >recursive slide show (careful with implementation ,requires slideshow recode)
d>scroll to first matching file during tab completion typing in main window.
 >allow multiple columns when viewing thumbs and tools float. (multi column clist?)
 >add bookmark type option.
 >allow to sort files by date and size.
 >add destination move file preset type locations bound to 1 - 0 keys. (like editors?)
 >move to gdkpixbuf, when it is ready (1.0)
 >image list, like playlist in sound players
 >add vert drag bar
 >make *.jpg on command line show only jpg files, for ex.
