 must Fix for 2.0.1:
 -------------------

   2.0.1 addresses Debian bugs 281377, 288523, 291824, 292865, 308617

d> fix shift scroller mem leak
d> fix rounding error causing missing lines in image

d> merge fix for better handling of large thumbnails for images
   with a size between normal and large.

d> fix windows not to set USER_SIZE flag as we never use gtk_window_resize, USER_POSITION is plenty anyway.

d> update translations: cs(x) fr(x) ( )

d> UPDATE:.fr translation of "Bilinear" needs spelling fix.
          .fr translation for "Safe delete" is incorrect change to:
                    "Suppression récupérable"
          .fr typo fixes from Debian bug #281377
          .de translation typo rekuriv -> rekursiv (note missing s) Debian bug #291824
          .de translation "Top left" fix Debian bug #292865

d> add comment in config file that it is autogenerated and comments will be lost Debian bug #288523

d> copy/move dialogs text entry allow non-absolute paths that result in file copy/move to unexpected
   location (the current working directory of app) Debian bug #308617
   Fix is to not allow non-absolute paths (ie no '/' in front of destination path results in
   prepending source file's path and updates dialog to notify user an absulute path must be entered).
